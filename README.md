Project Domain: Academy Awards

In 2016, the campaign #OscarsSoWhite was created to call out the lack of diversity in nominations for the Academy Awards, Oscars. At that time when the digital activism went viral, “the Academy revealed that of its 6000 members, 93 percent were white and 76 percent were men. The median age was 63” (channel24). Therefore, our group is interested in the racial diversity in Oscar nominations and winners, especially focusing on underrepresented minorities and foreign nominees over time.

We used the [Oscar Award, 1927-2020](https://www.kaggle.com/unanimad/the-oscar-award), [Demographics of Academy Awards (Oscars) Winners](https://www.kaggle.com/fmejia21/demographics-of-academy-awards-oscars-winners), and the [Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset) to get background of the nominees. The datasets are combined and cleaned to focus on racial diversity for data analysis.

To run the system locally, use Python's ```http.server``` module on your command prompt.

1. Enter the command to start up the server:
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
```
2. Check the contents of the directory by going to the URL ```localhost:8080``` in your web browser.
