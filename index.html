        In 2016, the campaign #OscarsSoWhite was created to call out the lack of diversity in nominations for the 
        Academy Awards, Oscars. At that time when the the digital activism went viral, the Academy revealed that 
        of its 6000 members, 93 percent were white and 76 percent were men, while the median age was 63.

            The purpose of our information visualizations is to show the racial diversity (or lack thereof) of Academy 
            Award nominees and winners, especially focusing on underrepresented minorities and foreign nominees over time.

        Apart from the lack of racial diversity we have seen from the Academy Awards, there are not many international 
        films that won Best Picture, one of the big five awards presented by the Academy of Motion Picture Art and Sciences. 
        The geographic map below shows the number of films nominated or won the Academy Award from each country. 
        Different colors indicate the range of numbers, and there is an option to select between nominated films or 
        Oscar-winning films using a dropdown button. The number will also be shown when hovering at a country on the map.

        The visualizations show that the Academy Awards are not much inclusive until the recent years, 
        after the campaign #OscarsSoWhite. However, people still look forward to seeing new changes from the Academy and 
        the movie industry. On September 2020, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced new representation 
        and inclusion standards for Oscars, which could be another stage of improving diversity and inclusion for the Orcars 
        nominees in the future.
